# DIYSplitKeyboard
Self made split keyboard, based on a diode matrix with Arduino ATmega32U4

Hi!
This repo holds the Arduino C Code for a self made ergonomical split-keyboard.
As of now, there is no How-To or extensive Readme available. If you're interested, feel free to leave a star or write me. Eventually, I will then make a tutorial how to build your own mechanical, ergonomical keyboard.

Cheers
